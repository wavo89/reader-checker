I'm aware theres a lot of spaghetti code here, was more just testing the limits of what I could set up quickly in vanilla JS to build an interactive UI that is also connected to AI while hosting from a server instance, in this case running Flask in python.

I don't plan to refactor, if I continue project I will probably write from scratch and use different tooling.
